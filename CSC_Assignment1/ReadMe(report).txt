Qustion 1
1.This code is saved in q1.py
2.This program allows the user to input the final account value, annual interest rate (the unit is %) and the number of years.
These numbers should be positive real numbers.
The output would be the initial value of money that has to be saved to obtain the final account value.
If the user fails to input a qualified number, the user will receive a reminder and be asked to input again until the qualified number appears.
3.Execute as followings:
Enter the final account value:10000
Enter the annual interest rate:2.3
Enter the number of years:5
The initial value is: 8925.279628922432

Question 5
1.This code is saved in q5.py
2.This program allows the user to input a positive  integer  N.
The output would be all the prime numbers which are smaller than N with at most 8 prime numbers in each line.
If the user fails to input a qualified number, the user will receive a reminder and be asked to input again until the qualified number appears.
3.Execute as followings:
PLease enter a positive integer:78
The prime numbers smaller than 78 include:
2       3       5       7       11      13      17      19
